              Hey there, 1401 gang! So, I've got this crazy idea. How about we
              shake off the dust and get our legs moving with a group run? Yep,
              you heard it right! Picture this: us, pounding the pavement,
              having a blast, and maybe making some new friends along the way.
              If you're wondering who I am, I'm Badri, the dude you've probably
              seen around with Teddy, the tiny black Havanese.

              I think this run will be really fun! It's not just about
              exercising - it's also about having a good time and getting to
              hang out. Sound interesting to you? If you're interested, fill in
              the form below, and if you've got any thoughts, spill the beans!
              I'm all ears for your feedback, good or bad.

              I'm a newbie at running and I absolutely despise doing it alone
              (hopefully, you're in the same boat). Let's be real, running with
              a bunch of people will totally light a fire under our lazy butts!
              Team work makes the dream work right?
